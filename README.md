A speech practice app for iOS and Android, built with Expo.

Read a passage out loud. Clarity listens, scores how you spoke, and tracks your
progress over time.

## What it does

- **Practice** — read from a library of passages (stories, news, poetry, tongue
  twisters), run short drills, or speak freestyle on a random topic. You can also
  add your own passages.
- **Live feedback** — a teleprompter follows your voice while you read, with a
  live word count, waveform, and pace readout.
- **Scoring** — each session gets one speaking score out of 100, plus five
  skills: Articulation, Flow, Pacing, Fillers, and Expression.
- **AI coaching** — a short written note after each session that points at the
  most useful thing to work on next.
- **Analytics** — score trend by week, month, or all time, along with practice
  time, session count, streak, and the words you keep stumbling on.

History renders from on-device stores first and syncs to Convex after Clerk
authenticates the account, so returning users still get an offline first frame.

## Stack

- Expo SDK 57, React Native 0.86, Expo Router (file-based routes)
- `expo-speech-recognition` for on-device transcription
- Azure Speech pronunciation assessment for word-level accuracy (optional)
- Expo Router API route + Vercel AI Gateway for the coaching text
- MMKV for local storage
- SF Pro Rounded and Hugeicons Pro for the UI

## Getting started

You need a development build. Expo Go cannot run this app, because speech
recognition and MMKV need native code.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the keys
bunx expo run:ios            # or: bunx expo run:android
```

The iOS Simulator has no reliable speech input. Use a real device for audio
behavior, or set `EXPO_PUBLIC_MOCK_PRACTICE=1` to run passage and freestyle UI
against deterministic scripted sessions. The EAS `simulator` profile enables
that automatically.

### Environment

| Variable                          | Required | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`              | For AI coaching | Server-only key for the coaching API route |
| `AI_COACH_MODEL`                  | No       | Defaults to `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite`      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`    | No       | Word-level pronunciation scoring                |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` | No       | Azure region for the key above                  |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes    | Clerk development or production publishable key |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`          | Yes      | Matching Convex deployment URL                   |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_SIGNIN_EMAIL`    | QA       | Existing `+clerk_test` user for simulator auth   |
| `APP_VARIANT`                     | Local    | `development`, `preview`, or `production`       |
| `HUGEICONS_TOKEN`                 | Install  | Needed to install the Hugeicons Pro packages    |

Without Azure, sessions still score. The app falls back to its own alignment of
the transcript against the passage text.

## Scripts

```bash
bun test          # pure-logic tests for history, stats, alignment, and WAV
bun run ios       # build and run on iOS
bun run android   # build and run on Android
bun start         # Metro only
```

## Project layout

```
app/           Screens and routes (tabs, session flow, API route)
components/    UI components, grouped by screen area
hooks/         React state: sessions, history, coaching
lib/           Pure logic: scoring, stats, alignment, formatting
services/      Side effects: recognition, Azure, storage, history
constants/     Passages, drills, topics, colors, fonts, metrics vocabulary
```

`lib/` and `constants/` stay pure. They never import from `services/`, so the
scoring math runs under bun in the test scripts.
